                <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
                <h3>Returns</h3>
                <p>Due to the nature of prescription products, we are unable to accept returns. This policy is in place
                    to comply with safety regulations and ensure the integrity of all medications we dispense. Once a
                    prescription order has been shipped, it cannot be returned for a refund or exchange, even if
                    unopened.</p>

                <h3>Replacements</h3>
                <p>Our replacement policy for prescription products requires that all claims be submitted to
                    <b> Info@vitalogixs.com</b> within 48 hours of receiving the shipment. To be eligible for a
                    replacement, you
                    must provide a clear photo of the product packaging, the vial (if applicable), and the lot number.
                    Additionally, please include a written explanation detailing the issue. This information helps us
                    assess the claim and ensure proper handling moving forward. Claims that do not include the required
                    documentation or are submitted outside the 48-hour window may not be eligible for replacement.</p>

                <h3>Refunds</h3>

                    contact form on our website, via email at , or our customer service line: 800-818-1779. Please
                    provide your order information, date of purchase, and a brief reason for a refund. Upon receiving a
                    refund request, our team will investigate and initiate the refund process if valid. The duration of
                    the refund process will depend on your payment gateway. We reserve the right to amend these policies
                    at any time with or without notice. Should you have any queries regarding this policy or wish to
                    request a refund, please contact us via the
