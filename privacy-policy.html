                    your PHI. In most cases, we only use or disclose the minimum amount of PHI required to achieve
                    the purpose of the disclosure.</p>

                <p>Vitalogixs may revise this Privacy Notice at any time. Any updates will apply to the information
                    we currently maintain as well as future records. If you have any questions regarding this
